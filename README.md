# Attribution Mining and Search Query Relevance Predictionfor E-Commerce Data

Abstract
Search relevancy plays a key role in improving sales in any ecommerce industry. The relevance of search
results and the search query is often inaccurate. In order to cater to this problem, we propose to improve the
search relevance accuracy by leveraging on the machine learning algorithms and data.

Dataset Description:

- Data fields - Search query, product title, project description, product id, name, relevance.
- Features â€“ search query length, product brand popularity, product title frequency, product description
    match, product category match, product color match, product shape match, product title length,
    product title length, words in query, words in product title, words in product description, ratio of
    words in product description to length of query, ratio of words in product title to length of query,
    distance between query vector and product vector, TF-IDF between query and product,...
